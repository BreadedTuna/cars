It works. But this is something to do with the main code of the game and kind of unrelated but I was just curious about this:
So basically imagine someone was in game and hosting a game waiting for someone to join, I have my admin panel and change there colour OR change it directly in the database, for the person I changed the colour for, there colour will stay the same for them, I also found that if I switch tab on the player I’m trying to change the colour of and I change the colour or another value like lap, the value stays like that until I return to the tab and in the database it automatically turns back to what it was previously. This likely isn’t a bug but it’s interesting because if I change the colour of a player or name then turn back to the tab until someone joins the game, the person who joined the player will see the player we changed (the host) with the values changes like different colour or name, but the host (player we changed) still can’t see the changed colours of themself or any other changed value. And if someone else is already in the game when a value changes, they won’t see the changes of the colour/name (I’m just using these as examples of values that we can change, could be checkpoint/lap too). I expect this is because each client has client data which includes name colour position speed lap, distance and more, these things can be changed on the client in the console by typing something like players.yourid.lap = 3 which would make you win the game, but it would only show that for you and would not be validated on the server (this is good) . But I guess it works vice versa so if the server can’t write to the clients? Idk it’s weird, what do you think? this isn’t something with adminui it’s just how the game works.
